    "in `projectGoal`, we calculated the true XYZ target coords for the goal, relative to the extake as the origin. $T_0=(T_x,T_y,T_z)$ represents the initial position of the target. $v_r=(v_x,v_y,v_z)$ represents the linear velocity of the robot through the IMU (excluding gravity). therefore, given time, the effective target position we should be aiming at can be defined as $T(t)=T_0-v_rt$. assume that, given time, $P(t)$ represents the position of the projectile. therefore, we want to find for what time is $T(t)=P(t)$ true. how we calculate the projectile position given time will vary from shooter to shooter and shooter design to shooter design. we can only shoot at a fixed angle, at a variable velocity $v_{0}$. therefore, let us call the elevation $\\theta$ and the azimuth (bearing) $\\phi$. we set $g=9.81m/s$. because `projectGoal` sets the extake as the origin, we don't have to calculate any offsets. the trajectory, as a function of time in 3D space, would be:\n",
